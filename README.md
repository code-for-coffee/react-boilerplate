# React Boilerplate

> Starter Code for React Apps

## Setup

*Note: Before installing local dependencies you get Gulp and Browserify installed globally. Run `npm install -g gulp-cli browserify bower` if needed.*

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install && bower install` (you need `gulp-cli`, `bower`, and `browserify` installed globally too)
3. Run `gulp` to start a local server and watch process

## Running it locally

Once all dependencies are installed just run `gulp`. This will:

- Watch all CSS, LESS, JS, JSX files for changes and run any transpilers, uglify, or linters
- Start the Express server on port 3000

[Go to http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in action.
